LibCSS API & ABI Changes
========================

  This document explains how to upgrade clients to use new versions of LibCSS.


LibCSS 0.2.0 --> LibCSS 0.3.0
-----------------------------

  Both the API and ABI are changed.

  LibCSS nolonger lets clients provide a memory allocator function.
  This change affects the following functions:

    From include/libcss/computed.h    --  css_computed_style_create()

    From include/libcss/select.h      --  css_select_ctx_create()

    From incluce/libcss/stylesheet.h  --  css_stylesheet_create()


  There are changes to selection handler callback table:

    node_classes
      LibCSS nolonger frees the any array of classes passed to the
      node_classes callback.  It does still unref the individual strings.
      This means clients need not allocate a new array each call, but can
      keep the array cached on the node.

    set_libcss_node_data
      New selection handler function used to store a private cache belonging
      to libcss on document element nodes.  When the node is deleted or
      modified, clients should call css_libcss_node_data_handler().

    get_libcss_node_data
      New selection handler function used to retrieve private cache belonging
      to libcss from document element nodes.
