This directory contains an STL-compatible wrapper for Henry
Spencer's (modified) regular expression library.  See
../README for more details on the library.

The directory also contains a small test (retest.cpp) which
illustrates how to use the library.  Note that the test is
slightly obfuscated because it has to compile in
REGEXP_UNICODE mode as well as in normal mode.  The provided
Makefile will compile the library and the test in a single
executable, provided you have GNU C++ somewhere in your
path.
