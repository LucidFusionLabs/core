On most Unix-like systems, you should be able to install libarchive
and bsdtar using the following common steps:
    ./configure
    make
    make install

If you need to customize the target directories or otherwise adjust
the build setting, use
    ./configure --help
to list the configure options.

If you are developing libarchive and need to update the
configure script and other build files:
    /bin/sh build/autogen.sh

On non-Unix-like systems, use the "cmake" utility (available from
http://cmake.org/) to generate suitable build files for your platform.
Cmake requires the name of the directory containing CmakeLists.txt and
the "generator" to use for your build environment.  For example, to
build with Xcode on Mac OS, you can use the following command:
    cmake -G "Xcode" ~/libarchive-download-dir/
